TITLE
-----
Discrete Event Simulator for P2P Cryptocurrency

--------------------
COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
Makefile is provided with the code. The program can be build using default make arguments.

$ make
	compiles the code and produces a ./a.out executable file in current directory

$ make clean
	- deletes the .dot and .ps files from ./graphs/ directory
	- deletes ./a.out file from current directory
	

----------------------
HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
----------------------
$ ./a.out <n> <z> <maxEvents>
	- runs the program with following command line arguments:
	  * n - number of peers in the network
	  * z - percentage slow nodes, a number between 0 and 1
	  * maxEvents - maximum number of combined events to be generated during simulation

	example: $ ./a.out 10 0.3 5000

$ python draw.py
	- generates the tree for blockchain of each node in the network in ./graphs/ directory
